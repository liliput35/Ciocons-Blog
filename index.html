            <h3>PART 4 super last dc</h3>
            <p>
            Part 4 and hopefully the last dc fandome post. Aside from those dc projects, they will also be releasing a trailer for the first ever dceu tv show, Peacmaker. The show is 
              written and directed by the suicide squad director, James Gunn. It is set after the events of the movie where waller assigns a task to peacemaker. The last time we saw peacemaker was when
               he got "killed" by bloodsport and also in the credits scene where he was still alive. The show will also introduce Peacmaker's partner, Vigilante/Adrian Chase. The last time we saw vigilanter was in the arrow show. 
              they made vigilante and adrian chase 2 completely different characters. The costume design for vigilante in the Peacemaker show looks great tho. also excited for that

            <h3>PART 3 flash</h3>
            <p>
             For the flash movie. They might release a teaser for the Flash movie coming out in december of 2022. The movie is said to go back to previous dceu events and rewrite them all, creating a new dc universe. 
              The dceu is a mess right now and the flash movie might fix that. We dont even know who is superman right now. Michael Keaton's Batman, Ben Affleck's batman, and Sasha Calle's supergirl has been confirmed to appear in the film. 
              Maybe they will also pay back the previous encounter Ezra's flash and Grant's flash meeting in the speed force back in crisis on infinite earths. We might get a first look and teaser for the flash as well.
              For the tv show side of flash. Season 8, the last season, is gonna come out on November 16. So far we know that it will start off with a 5 episode crossover event. Leaked set photos show 
              Grant's flash wearing gold boots. It took them 7 years to give the fans what they want and that is gold boots. Hopefully the writing will improve and they can end the show in a very good and memorable way. 
              They still need to pay off the Flash vs Reverse Flash fight in season 1 where thawne ended up killing barry's mother. overall, super excited for what dc has to offer us tonight or tomorrow.

            <h3>PART 2 of pre dc fandome thoughts</h3>
            <p>
             Aside from the Batman, they will also be releasing a first look at Black Adam and The Flash. Black Adam has been in production for more than 10 years now. 
              It was announced in 2007 that the rock, Dawayne Johnson, will be playing Black Adam in the Shazam film. He was already casted as black adam before the entire marvel cinematic universe existed. 
              Black Adam is the first hero that the gods chose during ancient times but he turned out to be a bad guy because the gods did not choose wisely. In 2019 they chose Billy Batson to be SHAZAM. 
              Shazam has the powers of the gods. the wisdom of Solomon, strength of Hercules, stamina of Atlas, power of Zeus, courage of Achilles, and the speed of Mercury. spelling the name SHAZAM. 
              Hopefully we get to see a first look or a teaser of the Black Adam movie. Super excited. part 3 soon.

            <h3>Back and dcfandome</h3>
            <p>
             Took a break from blogging and coding for 23 days. I got my 2nd vaccine shot. Experienced side effects. Mocha gave birth to 2 puppies, Oreo and Peanut. 
              I finished my react project, built a meme generator using apis and react. DC Fandome is in 8 hours, so hyped. It is an event where they showcase upcoming DC projects,
               release new trailers and footage. They will be focusing on the upcoming Batman film this dc fandome, they will release the official trailer for it. So far we have a teaser
              , some photos that were posted by the director, and set photos and videos. They had a test screening again and it is a nearly 3hour long detective noir film. We are finally gonna be getting
               a detective batman in live action. The closest we got to that was in the dark knight movie in 2008 where he got fingerprints off a shattered bullet. The story reportedly takes place
               on halloween and will go on for a week. Bruce keeps a journal that he narrates to the audience(batman year one vibes). Speaking of year one this will not be an origin story for him 
              but it is his 2nd year as batman where he is still not respected as a hero but more of a vigilante. The people who watched the film said that it will contain some horror elements 
              and the riddler is just straight up scary. Robert's portrayal of the batman is said to be great. Jeffreu Wright, the actor who plays commisioner gordon and the watcher in marvel's what if 
              , said that Robert did an amazing job as batman. He created 3 personas, Batman, Bruce Wayne, and himself. part 2 soon.

            <p>
              So today we had leadersip training. Woke up way too early for that
              cuz program started at 8 and attendance was checked in the middle
              of the program. Didn't have breakfast today cuz there was nothing
              to eat. The program was alrigth if it wasn't for the kid that I
              got grouped with he was unbearable. Even the facilitator got tired
              of him but at first it was funny as it went on everyine got tired
              of him. After the program i just chilled and did socials . I went
              to the mall at 5 to buy stuff but there was no charger available
              so i got a shirt instead. I bought chicken, potato sticks, and
              milktea for my snacks and it was nice.

            <p>
              So the aftermath of yesterday's workout was that I got aching all
              through out my body like the core and hamstrings. I woke up with
              muscle pains. Today was a different day than the others. I started
              learning React Js its kinda like javascript but broken down into
              smaller components so that it will be more convenient Im currently
              working on a task tracker app. I made and ate fried rice for
              breakfast. I attended my first club meeting the start up club. ngl
              it was awkward af cuz nobody was participating. ty

              the teacher assigned us some exercises to do and they were super
              tiring. Maybe its bcuz that i haven't exercised in a long time or
              the exercise it slef were tiring . There was jogging, squats,
              sit-ups, and planking. I also cleaned my shoes after delaying it
              for almost a week. We had pizza for snaks and it was good. Have a
              good night everyone

              Just finished my precal test. I think i did a pretty good job

              that hard just repeating questions and common sense ones. Couldn't
              blog yesterday sorry bout that fell asleep for 3 hours after class
              and woke up for dinner. Didn't also do much yesterday just some
              basic school works and ate pizza from nicks. It was alright.
