                <h3>Workout and pizza</h3>
                <p>SO today i had a work out session for the first time in a while. the teacher assigned us some exercises to do and they were super tiring. Maybe its bcuz that i haven't exercised in a long time or the exercise it slef were tiring
                . There was jogging, squats, sit-ups, and planking. I also cleaned my shoes after delaying it for almost a week. We had pizza for snaks and it was good. Have a good night everyone</p>

                <h3>Pfizer hit hard</h3>
                <p>You might already know that I got vaccinated yesterday, and when u get vaccinated u experience side effects. Sooo i think i had a fever today together with some very painful headaches
                 . I also made iced chocolate, and cooked food instead of buying. I was almost gonna order a burger from foodpanda but i made the wise decision to save and make food instead road to new earphones. ty</p>
