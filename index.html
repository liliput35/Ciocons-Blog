              Mina got trapped in the movie room for the whole night and she didn't even make a singe sound but if you cage Chewy she will bark like theres no tomorrow. I am
               40% done with learning react. I still have like 3 more hours to go. I slept early yesterday. Haven't done that in a while cuz school. yeah ty

            <p>
              I finished my comeelc website project. It featured my new mobile
              navbar that has the menu icon animaton. I also updated the menu
              icons on my previous websites as well. I enrolled in a new course
              in scrimba about learning react. It is my 2nd day of learning
              react and it is not that hard yet. Im taking notes to help me
              remember and understand it. So far i know understand react
              componenets and functions and working on the map array method.

              Today is September 14. My last post was on september 11. Coundn't
              blog for the past days because i was busy with school work and
              coding. Teachers hae given a ton of classworks of us to finish.
              They already started to give the major pts of this quarter. I
              finished my react task tracker. Probably gonna make it a few more
              times to fully master it. Currently working on the website for the
              COMELEC. Have a great day ty.

            <h3>Leadershift</h3>
            <p>
              So today we had leadersip training. Woke up way too early for that
              cuz program started at 8 and attendance was checked in the middle
              of the program. Didn't have breakfast today cuz there was nothing
              to eat. The program was alrigth if it wasn't for the kid that I
              got grouped with he was unbearable. Even the facilitator got tired
              of him but at first it was funny as it went on everyine got tired
              of him. After the program i just chilled and did socials . I went
              to the mall at 5 to buy stuff but there was no charger available
              so i got a shirt instead. I bought chicken, potato sticks, and
              milktea for my snacks and it was nice.

            <h3>React and Body aches</h3>
            <p>
              So the aftermath of yesterday's workout was that I got aching all
              through out my body like the core and hamstrings. I woke up with
              muscle pains. Today was a different day than the others. I started
              learning React Js its kinda like javascript but broken down into
              smaller components so that it will be more convenient Im currently
              working on a task tracker app. I made and ate fried rice for
              breakfast. I attended my first club meeting the start up club. ngl
              it was awkward af cuz nobody was participating. ty

            <p>
              SO today i had a work out session for the first time in a while.
              the teacher assigned us some exercises to do and they were super
              tiring. Maybe its bcuz that i haven't exercised in a long time or
              the exercise it slef were tiring . There was jogging, squats,
              sit-ups, and planking. I also cleaned my shoes after delaying it
              for almost a week. We had pizza for snaks and it was good. Have a
              good night everyone

            <p>
              Just finished my precal test. I think i did a pretty good job
              except for the problem solving, it was confusing. Test was not
              that hard just repeating questions and common sense ones. Couldn't
              blog yesterday sorry bout that fell asleep for 3 hours after class
              and woke up for dinner. Didn't also do much yesterday just some
              basic school works and ate pizza from nicks. It was alright.

              You might already know that I got vaccinated yesterday, and when u

              fever today together with some very painful headaches . I also
              made iced chocolate, and cooked food instead of buying. I was
              almost gonna order a burger from foodpanda but i made the wise
              decision to save and make food instead road to new earphones. ty
